# Github Organization Tracker

A monitoring dashboard that tracks various stats across all repositories on an organization. At the moment it only tracks issue counts, but looking into extending to other data.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

```

Rename `.env.sample` to `.env.local` and fill in the respective information as well.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
