# Github Organization Tracker

A monitoring dashboard that tracks various stats across all repositories on an organization. At the moment it only tracks issue counts, but looking into extending to other data.

Built with Next.js, Supabase and AWS Lambda.

## Making it your own

### Set up Supabase

Head over to [Supabase](https://supabase.io) to set up a free project, and create a table with the following schema.

```
CREATE TABLE issues_test (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  organization text,
  repository text,
  open_issues integer,
  closed_issues integer,
  inserted_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL
);
```

### Set up AWS Lambda to start tracking issues

WIP

### Deployment

Fork this repo as your own repository and head over to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to set up a free deployment. You'll only need to update the environment variables as such:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_ORGANIZATION:  Your github organization name
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN:  Your personal github access token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_TABLE_NAME:  Name of the table that's tracking the issues
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:         URL to your Supabase project
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLIC_KEY:  Public anon key of your Supabase project
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORGANIZATION_LOGO:    Optional, the url to your organization's logo
```

## Local development

Firstly, fill up `.env.sample` with the environment variables as mentioned above under deployment, then rename the file to `.env.local`

Thereafter run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
